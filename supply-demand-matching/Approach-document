demands and supply should be time sorted


Approach

case 2: demand is more, supply is less

case 3: demand and supply is equal

Using priority queue to maximize the profit according to their price of supplier and demands.

if supply is there but no demand or supply is unable to fulfill the demand the save it Map for further demands.

then new demand comes and supply is already exist then we will check whether supply is able to full fill the existing demand or not.. 

if demand is there but no supply or No supply to fulfill the dmand then save it into a map for further execution. 

then new supply comes and demand is already exist then we will check new suupply is able to fulfill the demand or not
